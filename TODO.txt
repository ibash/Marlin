Goal:

- Run the marlin 2 firmware with fixes
- Subgoal: Figure out what changes were made to the marlin firmware so that they
  can be reproduced

Problems:

- There isn't a common history between this repo and marlin.
- There are commits with a lot of deleted files.


Approach:

1. Add marlin as the "upstream" remote
2. Checkout the tag upstream 1.1.6 as "upstream-1.1.6"
3. Find out what files were deleted:

   git diff upstream-1.1.6..origin/1.1.6 --diff-filter=D --name-only

4. Restore deleted files:

   git diff upstream-1.1.6..origin/1.1.6 --diff-filter=D --name-only | tr \\n \\0 | xargs -0 git checkout upstream-1.1.6 -- ${}

5. Commit them

6. Take a look at the diff again:

   git diff -w upstream-1.1.6..HEAD
